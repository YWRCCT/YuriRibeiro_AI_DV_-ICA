Tasks for Artificial Intelligence

Ciara is looking for employees for her new company, which develops and provides AI based logistic software for retailers. Ciara has determined that she needs:

2 Python Programmers, 2 AI Engineers, 1 Web Designer, 1 Database Admin, and 1 Systems Engineer.
Assume that if a person has two abilities, he or she can take on two roles in the company.

So Ciara narrowed down her selections to the following people:

Name 	Abilities
Peter 	Python and AI
Juan 	Web and AI
Jim 	AI and Systems
Jane 	Python and Database
Mary 	Web and Systems
Bruce 	Systems and Python
Anita 	Web and AI

Scenario 1:

Suppose Ciara knows Python, and only has funds to hire three more people.

Scenario 2:

Suppose Ciara and Juan become partners, with the additional funds they can now employ four more people but must employ another AI Engineer, so they need 2 Python Programmers, 3 AI Engineers, 1 Web Designer, 1 Database Admin, and 1 Systems Engineer.

1.	Using any CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) framework (using variables, value domains, and constraints), discover if the above problems can be solved and if so detail who would be in hired.[0-30] 
2.	Discuss in detail how using Constraint Satisfaction finds an answer or finds no solution to the problems in Tasks for Artificial Intelligence part 1. How does this differ from standard algorithmic solutions? .[0-30] 
3.	These problems be solved using several other algorithm’s we have studied in the module. Choose one of these algorithms and discuss your answer in detail including a proof of your hypothesis in code .[0-30] 
4.	Support your arguments with citations/references in Harvard Style .[0-10]   

Tasks for Data Visualisation

●	Use appropriate visualisations to help communicate the CSP scenario and the corresponding solutions, if any, to the appropriate stakeholders.
●	Create interactive visualisation(s) to allow a user to explore alternate constraint scenarios
●	Create GUI(s) to allow a user to explore alternate constraint scenarios
●	Include in your report a section for a theoretical AI “team” you are part of, explaining the visualisation processes and rationalising your visualisation decisions (eg chart choice, colour, layout etc).
